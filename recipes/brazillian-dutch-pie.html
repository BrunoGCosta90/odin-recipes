    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Are you confused by the title? I know it's confusing,
         this recipe was created in 1991 by the  brazillia chef SÃ­lvya Leite. 
         She named it <em>Torta Holandesa</em>, which is the portuguese 
         translation to Dutch Pie. She decided on that name after the 
         good times she had when travelling in Europe.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>To make the crust</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Pulse the graham crackers in a food processor until finely crumbled.</li>
        <li>Transfer them to a large bowl and add the softened butter. 
            Using your hands, mix the crumbs and the butter until a mass 
            resembling wet sand forms.</li>
        <li>Press the mixture into a 9" Springform pan (with removable 
            bottom), previously greased with nonstick spray.</li>
        <li>Line the digestive cookies around the edges of the pan, 
            gently pressing them against the graham cracker crust.</li>
        <li>Cover and bring to the fridge for at least one hour.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>To make the cream filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Add the egg yolks (strained, if possible), the sweet condensed 
            milk and the milk to a sauce pan and bring to a boil over 
            medium low heat. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring 
            constantly, until you obtain a thick cream.</li>
        <li>Add the gelatin package and the cold water to a microwave 
            safe bowl and bring it to the microwave, 5 seconds at a time, 
            until dissolved.</li>
        <li>Add the dissolved gelatin to the cream mixture and stir 
            until combined. Remove from heat and let it cool.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, whip the heavy cream with the aid of a 
            hand mixer, until firm peaks form.</li>
        <li>When the cream mixture is cool, fold the whipped cream in 
            with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture in the Springform pan, smoothing the surface 
            with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Cover with plastic and bring to the fridge for at least 3 
            hours, or overnight.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>To make the chocolate ganache</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>In a saucepan, heat the heavy cream, over medium heat, for 
            about 5 minutes or until it begins to boil.</li>
        <li>Combine the hot heavy cream and the chocolate chips in a 
            bowl and stir until the chocolate has melted.</li>
        <li>Pour the chocolate ganache on the cream pie.</li>
        <li>Cover with plastic and bring to the fridge for at least one 
            hour.</li>
        <li>Your pie is now ready to be served!</li>
    </ul>
