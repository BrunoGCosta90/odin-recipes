    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Brazilian Stroganoff is super simple and easy to make, 
        but full of flavor. The typical Brazilian stroganoff is 
        served along with white rice and potato sticks.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 chicken breasts (boneless, skinless) (cut into small pieces)</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves (minced)</li>
        <li>½ Onion (diced)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoon Ketchup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon mustard</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream (or one can of table cream)</li>
        <li>salt to taste (about ¼ teaspoon table salt)</li>
        <li>¼ cup tomato sauce (optional)</li>
        <li>1 4oz can sliced mushrooms (optional)</li>
        <li>1 cup mushrooms</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Over the same board that you cut the chicken, 
            sprinkle some salt over the chicken.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, over medium heat, 
            melt butter and saute onion until translucent. 
            Add chicken in a single layer, and let it sear for a 
            little bit.</li>
        <li>When pieces get some color, push it all to one side and 
            add the garlic. If necessary add a tiny bit of olive oil, 
            just to help sauteing it, for about 30 seconds. Add Ketchup, 
            mustard, soy sauce and canned mushrooms (If using. If you 
            prefer to use corn, add it at the end of the recipe). Mix 
            everything.</li>
        <li>Check if chicken is done, if it's not, lower the heat, cover 
            the pan and let it cook for a bit longer (until no longer 
            pink inside, or thermometer registers F165). Add a little 
            bit of water if you see that the mixture is drying out.</li>
        <li>Once chicken is cooked, but still soft and moist (don't over 
            cook it, or it will be hard and dry), turn off the heat, add 
            heavy cream (or table cream), stir well to combine everything, 
            and try it. Correct salt if necessary, and if you like it more 
            acidic, add ¼ cup of tomato sauce. My family likes it more 
            without the tomato sauce. If you opted for using corn, add 
            the corn now and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Enjoy it over rice, along with some potato sticks.</li>
    </ol>
